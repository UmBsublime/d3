This is really in an alpha stage and not all features below are present/functional.
I will add a  basic interface for you to try soon.

Pull meaningful stats from the diablo 3 api.

mainly:
  - Compiled stats of combination of different items
  - Total bonus elemental dmg from all sources
  - General Diablo stats
  - Detailed information about items
  - Comparision between an item you own and the best possible match
